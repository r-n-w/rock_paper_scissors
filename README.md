<h2>Rock Paper Scissors</h2>

A simple but competitive childhood game. The computer is guessing here, I swear it doesn't check your answer before deciding what to play!

A fun open-ended project making the game logic, the adding some animations, then testing on some family and friends to learn what was intuitive, and what needed work. Was an eye opening experience in how easy it is to break things the the UI doesn't make it obvious what to do.
